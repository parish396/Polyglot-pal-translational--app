Polyglot Pal - Language Translation AppTable of ContentsAbout the ProjectFeaturesTechnologies UsedGetting StartedPrerequisitesInstallationAPI Key ConfigurationRunning the ApplicationUsageProject StructureContributingLicenseAcknowledgementsAbout the ProjectPolyglot Pal is a simple yet powerful web-based language translation application designed to provide quick and accurate translations between multiple languages. It leverages the power of the Gemini API to deliver contextual and reliable translations, offering a seamless experience for users needing to bridge language barriers.This project was developed with a focus on a clean, intuitive user interface and robust functionality, demonstrating the integration of front-end web technologies with a powerful large language model API.FeaturesReal-time Translation: Translate text instantly between a wide range of languages.Language Selection: Easily select source and target languages from comprehensive dropdowns.Swap Languages: Quickly swap the source and target languages with a single click.Clear Input: Clear the input and output fields to start a new translation.Copy Output: Copy the translated text to your clipboard for easy use.Responsive Design: A user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).Error Handling: Provides clear feedback for translation errors or missing input.Loading Indicator: Informs the user when translation is in progress.Technologies UsedFrontend:HTML5CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling)JavaScript (ES6+)Backend (for serving static files - optional):Python 3Flask (a micro web framework for Python)Translation API:Google Gemini API (specifically gemini-2.0-flash)Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed:Web Browser: A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).Node.js (Optional, for React version): If you plan to work with the React version, Node.js and npm/yarn are required.Python 3 (for HTML/CSS/JS version with Flask server): If you want to serve the HTML/CSS/JS files using the provided Flask server.Gemini API Key: You will need an API key from Google AI Studio to enable the translation functionality.Get your API key here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeyInstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/polyglot-pal.git
cd polyglot-pal
(Replace your-username and polyglot-pal with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)For the HTML/CSS/JS version (if using Flask server):Install Flask:pip install Flask
API Key ConfigurationThe translation functionality relies on the Gemini API. You need to configure your API key in the JavaScript file.Open the script.js file (for the HTML/CSS/JS version) or the App.js file (for the React version).Locate the line where apiKey is declared:const apiKey = ''; // API key is provided by the environment
Replace the empty string '' with your actual Gemini API key:const apiKey = 'YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY_HERE'; // <--- PASTE YOUR API KEY HERE
Important: For production environments, it's recommended to handle API keys more securely (e.g., via a backend server or environment variables) rather than directly embedding them in client-side code.Running the ApplicationOption 1: HTML/CSS/JS with Live Server (Recommended for quick testing)If you have a "Live Server" extension in your IDE (like VS Code), you can simply open index.html with it.Right-click on index.html.Select "Open with Live Server".Option 2: HTML/CSS/JS with Python Flask ServerEnsure you have Flask installed (see Installation).Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.Run the Flask server:python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the address displayed in your terminal).Option 3: React VersionIf you have the React version of the app, follow these steps:Navigate into the React project directory (e.g., cd polyglot-pal-react).Install dependencies:npm install # or yarn install
Start the development server:npm start # or yarn start
The app will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.UsageSelect Source Language: Choose the language of the text you want to translate from the "From:" dropdown.Enter Text: Type or paste the text you wish to translate into the left-hand text area.Select Target Language: Choose the language you want to translate into from the "To:" dropdown.Translate: Click the "Translate" button. The translated text will appear in the right-hand text area.Swap Languages: Click the swap icon (two arrows) to quickly reverse the source and target languages.Clear Input: Click the "Clear" button below the input area to clear both text fields.Copy Output: Click the "Copy" button below the output area to copy the translated text to your clipboard.Project Structurepolyglot-pal/
